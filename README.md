This is a fork of Otopack for Cataclysm Bright Nights from Kenan2000. I plan on adding more sounds (duh) and fixes, I'm busy irl so don't expect frequent changes.

The bar for sound quality isn't that high for me personally, as long as it sounds like how it should then it's fine.

Contributions are welcome, I'll most likely release weekly or earlier releases containing all changes/additons.



Credits to SURVIVAL_MAN for the Original Otopack, Kenan2000 for his additions/fixes over the years and Aeiouuu01234 for the 450 Bushmaster addition from his version that I added for the 1st release (I don't even know if it works for BN lol).

Also credits to Fris0uman for the feral screams and zombie moaning folders and sounds, and CO.AG for their banging music :D->-< .

I do not own any of the sounds/music used, I am merely modifying this soundpack alongside others(or i'm just alone lol).
