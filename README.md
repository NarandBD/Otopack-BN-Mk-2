PRs from me will continue in January, at least setting aside a day or two to get something decent out to here before I have to go back to doing research for real life stuff. Thank you again for your patience.

# This is a fork of Otopack for Cataclysm Bright Nights from Kenan2000. I plan on adding more sounds and fixes, but I'm busy with real life stuff so updates will be infrequent.

I'll compile releases containing all changes/additons after a moderate amount of work has been done, with hotfixes and such as needed.

Contributions from others are welcome, my sentiment is as long as it sounds like how it should w/o copyright issues then It's fine.

_**If you want to get the latest updates/version, download the zip from the green button that says "<> code" above. Unzip the zip file, then drag and drop JUST Otopack+ModsUpdates BN into your sound folder. Make sure you have it set under settings.**_


Credits to SURVIVAL_MAN for the Original Otopack from the CDDA forums and Kenan2000 for his additions/fixes over the years, of which I added for the "What i have on hand" release (Aeiouuu01234's 450 Bushmaster addition is included in this release but not in more recent releases, as I only recently found out it doesn't exist in CBN).

Also credits to Fris0uman for the feral screams and zombie moaning folders and sounds (they will be/are being utilized), and CO.AG for their banging music!
