## This is a fork of Otopack for Cataclysm Bright Nights from Kenan2000. I plan on adding more sounds and fixes, I'm busy irl so don't expect frequency.

Contributions from others are welcome, I'll most likely release weekly or earlier releases containing all changes/additons.
As long as it sounds like how it should w/o copyright issues then it's probably fine.

_**If you want to get the latest updates/version, download the zip from the green button that says "<> code" above. Unzip the zip file, then drag and drop JUST Otopack+ModsUpdates BN into your sound folder. Make sure you have it set under settings.**_


Credits to SURVIVAL_MAN for the Original Otopack from the CDDA forums and Kenan2000 for his additions/fixes over the years, of which I added for the "What i have on hand" release (Aeiouuu01234's 450 Bushmaster addition is included in this release but not in more recent releases, as I only recently found out it doesn't exist in CBN).

Also credits to Fris0uman for the feral screams and zombie moaning folders and sounds (they will be/are being utilized), and CO.AG for their banging music!

:D->-<|:

I do not own any of the sounds/music used.
