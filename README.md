## This is a fork of Otopack for Cataclysm Bright Nights from Kenan2000. I plan on adding more sounds (duh) and fixes, I'm busy irl so don't expect frequent changes.
~~~
The bar for sound quality isn't that high for me personally, as long as it sounds like how it should then it's fine.

Contributions are welcome, I'll most likely release weekly or earlier releases containing all changes/additons.

_**If you want to get the latest updates/version, all you gotta do is download the zip from the green button that says "<> code" above. After that, drag and drop JUST Otopack+ModsUpdates BN into your sound folder. Then just make sure you have it set to it under settings.**_


Credits to SURVIVAL_MAN for the Original Otopack from the CDDA forums, Kenan2000 for his additions/fixes over the years and Aeiouuu01234 for the 450 Bushmaster addition from his fork that I added for the "What i have on hand" release (I don't even know if that gun is in BN lol).

Also credits to Fris0uman for the feral screams and zombie moaning folders and sounds (they will be/are being utilized), and CO.AG for their banging music!
:D->-<

I do not own any of the sounds/music used, I am merely adding to and modifying this soundpack alongside others.
