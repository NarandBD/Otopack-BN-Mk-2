### The sentiment for the direction of this soundpack summarized, parroted from [Building Cogmind’s Ambient Soundscape](https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2020/06/building-cogminds-ambient-soundscape/):

> For now though, music is probably not right...With an emphasis on immersive atmosphere, and a semi-realistic dark sci-fi one at that, I think environment-driven ambient audio would better fit the role...considering that the architecture for an environment-based ambient audio system (CBN doesn't have this but think of this as using environmental/ambience as music) already exists...it makes sense to start with this approach and experience the results to hear for ourselves. Let the machines and other objects of the world dynamically create the soundscape, and if that works then we’re all set.

> ...it’s heavily focused on sound effects and loops...I have more direct control over making sure each step along the way is successfully integrating with my vision.

* It doesn't encompass everything I have in my vision of this sound pack but I just want to make it obvious that I want ambience and sound effects to be the #1 things you hear, and heavily minimize if not entirely throw out music.
