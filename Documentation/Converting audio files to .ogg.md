### This is how to convert to .ogg whilst minimizing file size (for not technical people (that includes me)):

* First, go to https://convertio.co/
  
* Choose the file that you want to convert (.mp3, .mp4, etc)
  
* Where there's a dropdown menu with "..." in it, select ogg
  
* After that, click the gearbox that's directly to the right of the dropdown menu

* Click the dropdown menu for "Codec" and select FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)

_(If you find that another Codec works better, such as Ogg (Vorbis), then make sure to select lowest quality under the quality dropmenu. I haven't touched Speex or Opus, i'd suggest ignoring them unless you know what you're doing.)_

* Click the red box that says "Convert ->"

*  Wait till it finishes, and tada you now have your (hopefully small sized) .ogg file

## DO NOTE:
It won't hurt to try the other Codec options to see which one does a better job (both in terms of audio quality and file size).
In my testing, doing a already small file size with FLAC will get you a bigger file size after conversion, but converting files
that are already .ogg with this website will shave off a handful of Kilobytes with near identical audio quality.

**You are limited to how many files you can convert in a day**, but this can be circumvented with Tor if you use such (or probably a vpn).

If you know a better place and or method to convert audio files to .ogg and or reduce the file sizes of them then by all means go ahead,
this is mainly for contributers who dont know where to start. ~~unfortunately that includes me :(~~
